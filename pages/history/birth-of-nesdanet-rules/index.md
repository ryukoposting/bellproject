# Birth Of NESDAnet Rules

These files were ripped from a 3.5" floppy disk. In pencil, the disk
is labeled "Both of NESDAnet Rules." The files are timetamped between
January 12 and January 14, 2002.

These documents appear to lay out the rules for a set of email groups
collectively named "NESDAnet." Given where I know this disk came from,
I am certain that NESDA stands for "National Electronic Service Dealers
Association." I am certain of this

I have not provided a complete image of the floppy disk, because it also
includes several photos of people. It looks like the disk was used in
a Sony Mavica in July 2002. The photos appear to show three men in a
hotel room, wearing lanyards that suggest they were participating in
a convention. The photos are of typical "90s digital camera" quality, so
it's hard to read what their lanyards say. One man wears a polo shirt
that says "NPSC."
