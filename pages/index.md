Bell Project is an initiative to archive professional-grade technical reference
materials for vintage technology, especially audiovisual devices like
televisions, VCRs, and stereo equipment.

In addition, Bell Project archives software and technical materials for the
following computer platforms:

- RadioShack TRS-80 Model I, III, and 4 microcomputers.
- IBM PC and compatibles, up to and including i586 systems.
- Zenith Z-100, Z-110, and Z-120 microcomputers.

Archives of other stuff will pop up here and there.

Bell Project is named after Bell Television, an electronics repair shop that
served Chicago's north side from 1957 to 2014. Bell Television's exhaustive
collection of software and technical reference materials makes up the
overwhelming majority of content archived by Bell Project.

Bell Project was conceived by [Evan Grove](https://hardfault.life) in response
to the 2024 Internet Archive outages. IA is a priceless resource, but it's
also a single point of failure for nearly the entire ecosystem of
vintage software and technical resources. Bell Project was created in response
to the need for alternative resources for old, esoteric, and hard-to-find
digital resources.
